This is just a quick tool I created to create screenshots from JIRA (or anywhere else with just a little modification). Fill up links.txt with the urls you want screenshots of, fill out the credentials and the login url in the js and you should be good to go. I had to login to two separate JIRAs, that's why there is two in the JS.

install node

npm i

node screenshot-creator-2000.js
